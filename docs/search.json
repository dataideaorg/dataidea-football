    "text": "Image by DATAIDEA\n\n\n\nKey Points:\n\nManchester United decide to replace Ten Hag\nManager will leave even if he wins FA Cup\nKieran McKenna and Mauricio Pochettino are top targets\n\n\n\nWHAT HAPPENED?\nTen Hag will take charge of Manchester United for a final time at Wembley on Saturday in the FA Cup final as the Dutchman will depart the club this summer, according to Gianluca Di Marzio, via SoccerNews.nl. The Red Devils are already on the lookout for a new manager and will make a change even if Ten Hag masterminds an FA Cup final win over Manchester City.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE BIGGER PICTURE\nTen Hag’s future has become uncertain after a difficult campaign for the Red Devils. United finished the season down in eighth place in the Premier League table, with a negative goal difference, and will only play European football next season if they beat City in the final. Manchester United have already been linked with a move for Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna as well as England manager Gareth Southgate if Ten Hag does depart Old Trafford after the cup final. Former Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel and freshly unemployed Mauricio Pochettino are also thought to be in the frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT DI MARZIO SAID\nDi Marzio said: “McKenna is the man of the moment in the football world, in the world of coaches, because he is doing great at Ipswich Town. He is the number one choice at Brighton & Hove Albion, but he has also already spoken to Manchester United. At the end of the season, United will say goodbye to Ten Hag.\n“Manchester United will also be looking for a new coach. And their targets are McKenna and Mauricio Pochettino. De Zerbi is also on the list, but he has not been in contact with United in recent days. If he [McKenna] goes to Chelsea, United will go for Pochettino. But what is certain: they are saying goodbye to Ten Hag.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT NEXT\nManchester United are not the only club looking for a new coach this summer. Bayern Munich, Juventus, Brighton, and Chelsea are also on the hunt for a first-team coach, while Barcelona are being tipped to part ways with Xavi and could also join the list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like:\n\n\n\nWhy Bayern are after Kompany\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "title": "Why are Bayern after Vincent Kompany?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Image by DATAIDEA\n\n\nAfter a difficult Bundesliga season, Bayern Munich looks likely to hire Burnley head coach Vincent Kompany as their new head coach.\nKompany, who won the Premier League four times as a player with Manchester City and learned German during his time as a player with Hamburger SV, is seen as one of the top up-and-coming head coaches.\nHe started his coaching career at Belgian side Anderlecht, where he led them to a cup final in 2022, before moving to English side Burnley. At Burnley, he won promotion back to the Premier League in 2022/23, amassing more than 100 points in the EFL Championship while playing a style of soccer very different from Burnley’s more direct approach under previous boss Sean Dyche.\n\n\n\n\nBut this season, despite spending more on transfers than other teams in the lower part of the Premier League, and despite two of their relegation rivals getting given points deductions, Burnley was relegated this season after finishing 19th in the league table.\nBurnley won just five league games all season, two of which came against bottom-of-the-league Sheffield United, and only scored 41 goals, the second fewest in the league.\n\n\n\n\nSo why are Bayern Munich interested in Kompany?\nPart of the reason is that so many top clubs are looking for new head coaches and there aren’t that many options available. In an ideal world, Bayern might have wanted the likes of Xabi Alonso, who led Bayer Leverkusen to an undefeated Bundesliga season, or Arne Slot, who has just joined Liverpool. The Bavarian club were also reportedly turned down by Julian Nagelsmann and Ralf Rangnick.\nAnother reason is that there are some caveats to Burnley’s relegation. The gulf between the Championship and the Premier League is huge, and newly promoted sides need to spend big to have any chance of survival. Burnley’s spending seems even higher because the Clarets mainly targeted up-and-coming young talents like goalkeeper James Trafford, paying a premium for their potential to be stars several years down the line and for their high resale value.\n\n\n\n\nThe main reason Kompany is in the running for German soccer’s biggest job, though, is the style of play he looked to introduce at Burnley.\nKompany tried to get Burnley to build from the back and play a possession-based style of soccer, with the 12th most possession, 12th most passes with an average of 432 per game, and 12th best passing accuracy in the Premier League, while making very few crosses or counter-attacks. They were basically the second-best team in the bottom half when it comes to passing the ball around the pitch. This playing style starts with Burnley’s goalkeepers, James Trafford and Arijanet Muric, whose 1826 combined passes were more than the goalkeepers of any other Premier League team.\nThe statistics show that Kompany got Burnley playing an easy-on-the-eye style of soccer, but it lacked a cutting edge, with the Lancashire side unable to create chances in the penalty area, and subsequently having the worst expected goals per shot in the league.\n\n\n\n\nRelegation shouldn’t necessarily be a blot on a head coach’s career. Even Jurgen Klopp, while at Mainz, got relegated. But some Burnley fans must be wondering whether a more pragmatic approach might have given them a better chance of Premier League survival.\nIn the 2022/23 season, Steve Cooper tried playing a more expansive style of soccer with Nottingham Forest, but after a 4-0 loss to Leicester City, he changed to a more defense-first approach that in the end kept Forest in the Premier League.\nSean Dyche this season at Everton has played a style of soccer that some fans see as unwatchable, but it has kept Everton comfortably in the Premier League despite an eight-point deduction, and the Toffees would have finished even higher up the table had Dominic Calvert-Lewin been able to finish. Only Liverpool’s Darwin Nunez had a bigger deficit between expected goals and actual goals scored than the Everton striker. Dyche said after beating Liverpool 2-0 that he wanted “to play beautiful football if I can, but I want to play winning football first.”\n\n\n\n\nAnd in recent seasons, David Moyes’ supposedly ugly soccer took West Ham United to a European trophy and their most successful spell in the Premier League in a long time.\nHead coaches looking at the contrasting fates of Vincent Kompany, who is on the brink of one of the biggest jobs in soccer, and David Moyes, who left West Ham United this month, must be wondering whether beautiful soccer trumps winning soccer.\nMoyes and Dyche might be winning ugly, but Kompany’s beautiful defeats look to be better for his career.\n\n\nYou may like:\n\n\n\nBest Signings of 23/24 Season\n\n \n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Image by DATAIDEA\n\n\nChelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino, Brentford’s Thomas Frank, and Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag\nHow is Thomas Frank part of this conversation?\nWe like Thomas Frank. We think he’s a good manager. But we see nothing to suggest he’s a Manchester United upgrade on Erik ten Hag or Mauricio Pochettino.\nIt says a lot about how this summer is going on the managerial merry-go-round that this piece, conceived at 9am in response to Thomas Frank being heavily backed in for the Chelsea job has, in the time spent writing it, morphed into a Thomas Frank-Manchester United tale instead.\nSimply put, it is currently impossible to keep up with the absurd pace of developments around the manager hiring and firing game at the moment, and that’s especially true of Chelsea, a club that is violently unwell in a way we’ve never really seen before at the very top end of English football.\n\n\n\n\nWhile they now appear determined to appoint Enzo Maresca upon this very night, itself an extremely dubious upgrade on the departed Mauricio Pochettino, we’re left with 800 words to salvage. We could just bin it, but luckily this is the great Managergeddon of 2024. The bad news is that everything you write will be out of date before you finish it; the good news is that there will always be some way to repurpose it for another club beset by batsh*ttery.\nWe like Frank a lot, is the first thing to say here. He’s a fine manager doing a fine job at a fine club. He just seems a decent sort of bloke happy to quietly get on with the job at hand. All of that is also kind of the problem. We just don’t know what anyone is seeing that suggests he’s any kind of fit for Chelsea or now Manchester United.\nHe’s only 18 months younger than Pochettino and four years younger than Erik ten Hag. He’s from the same generation, just without anything like the top-level CV those guys enjoy. It’s fair to point out that it’s hard to use the absence of big-club experience against a manager getting a big-club job, because how else is one supposed to get that experience? But at the same time there is such overwhelming evidence that making a leap of this size just so rarely works.\n\n\n\n\nThere nearly always has to be a stepping stone between the small, well-run club and the gigantic superclub. The direct leap from small fry to big fish just almost never works.\nWe can’t be too effusive in our praise of Chelsea for looking beyond Frank given where they’ve landed instead. Maresca is at least a legitimately young coach at 44, but his entire first-team managerial career consists of 67 games with Parma (a reign that lasted only 14 matches) and Leicester, precisely none of which have been in the top flight. It’s an even bigger punt, if anything.\nFrank can at least point to a pretty solid Premier League record, even if he does join Roberto De Zerbi as a highly-rated Premier League manager who timed a disappointing season particularly poorly leading into this summer of carnage.\n\n\n\n\nBut can he point to anything that really resembles the challenge posed by your Manchester Uniteds or the Chelseas of this world? Anything at all that suggests he’s a legitimate upgrade on the inconvenient-trophy-snaffling Ten Hag rather than just a very good football manager quietly getting on with things at a lower level with vastly less attention and pressure?\nWe just don’t see it. If anything, the opposite is true. The one time Brentford have faced significant outside attention involving a big name was the Great and Trumpeted Return of Ivan Toney. And that went almost completely to sh*t after about five games.\nThe unique awkwardness of that particular situation was not remotely of Frank’s making, but nothing about his handling of it suggested a man about to go in and sort out the egos of a group of players who wouldn’t take Ralf Rangnick seriously.\n\n\n\n\nFrank may very well have the requisite charisma and energy for big-club management, but whether he – or anyone, really – could make the leap direct from a ‘bus stop in Hounslow’ to ‘This is Manchester United Football Club we’re talking about’ just seems so thoroughly doubtful. We’re certainly not clear why any set of big-club fans should particularly want to provide the proving ground, in any case.\nChelsea have decided to sack Pochettino, which is mad. United will probably still sack Ten Hag, which is less mad. That both appear to be casting their nets around some very untried managers is enormously perplexing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may like:\n\n\n\nUnited to Sack Ten H\n\n \n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Image by DATAIDEA\n\n\n\nBest European Signings of the 2023-24 Season\nWith the campaign almost over, DATAIDEA picks out the best bits of business done by the continent’s top clubs last summer…\nOne can never be quite sure how transfers will turn out. Even the most talented players can struggle at top clubs because of variables like personality clashes with the coach, fitness problems, language barriers, and cultural differences. However, some deals go better than anyone could have expected. This season, we’ve seen expensive signings handle the pressure of a big transfer fee, while other, previously unknown players have proven themselves bargain buys.\nBut, looking at all the deals done last summer, who’s proven the best value for money? Below, DATAIDEA ranks the 10 best signings of the season:\n\n\n\n10. Granit Xhaka - Bayer Leverkusen (£21.4m) Granit Xhaka left Arsenal to join an even more exciting young team managed by a better coach. At 31, Xhaka is playing the best football of his career, providing experience, tenacity, and technique to Xabi Alonso’s sensational Bayer Leverkusen side, who are now two games away from a treble after winning their first-ever Bundesliga.\n\n\n\n9. Riccardo Calafiori - Bologna (£3.4m) Riccardo Calafiori exemplifies the miraculous work done at Bologna by coach Thiago Motta and technical director Giovanni Sartori. The 21-year-old, bought from Basel for a pittance, played a pivotal role in Bologna’s qualification for the Champions League for the first time ever, transforming from a left-back into one of the classiest central defenders in Serie A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Jude Bellingham - Real Madrid (£88m) Jude Bellingham’s transfer from Borussia Dortmund to Real Madrid looked like a steal, and he’s proven it. Bellingham has had one of the most impressive debut seasons from a Galactico, scoring 23 goals, including two stoppage-time Clasico winners. He could next week get his hands on the Champions League trophy.\n\n\n\n7. Marcus Thuram - Inter (free) Inter snapped up Marcus Thuram on a free transfer after his contract with Borussia Monchengladbach expired. With his pace, hold-up play, and selfless running, Thuram proved the ideal foil for Lautaro Martinez and contributed 15 goals himself. No wonder Inter fans have forgotten about Romelu Lukaku!\n\n\n\n6. Viktor Gyokeres - Sporting CP (£17m) Viktor Gyokeres went from playing Championship football to being linked with Europe’s biggest clubs after a stellar season with Sporting CP. The Swede has an outrageous record of 43 goals in all competitions, helping Sporting win the title and aim for a domestic double.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Victor Boniface - Bayer Leverkusen (£17m) Victor Boniface missed two-and-a-half months of the season through injury but still scored 21 goals and made nine assists. His powerful and prolific play made him the leading man for Leverkusen, a perfect fit in their attack.\n\n\n\n4. Artem Dovbyk - Girona (£6.6m) Artem Dovbyk played a crucial role in Girona’s shocking third-place finish in La Liga, securing Champions League qualification. The Ukraine international scored 21 goals, outshining even Robert Lewandowski.\n\n\n\n3. Alexander Sorloth - Villarreal (£8.5m) Alexander Sorloth blossomed at Villarreal, topping the La Liga scoring charts with 23 goals in 33 games. After struggling at Leipzig, Sorloth found his form in Spain, leading the Pichichi race.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang - Marseille (free) Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang revived his career at Marseille after a doomed spell at Chelsea. At almost 35, Aubameyang has been involved in more goals this season than many young stars, playing for the eighth-best team in Ligue 1.\n\n\n\n1. Alex Grimaldo - Bayer Leverkusen (free) Alex Grimaldo tops the list, contributing significantly to Leverkusen’s historic campaign. Arriving from Benfica for nothing, Grimaldo formed a devastating wing-back pairing with Jeremie Frimpong, creating 17 goals and scoring 12 himself. His winning mentality and brilliant performances made him the signing of the season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Image by DATAIDEA\n\n\nBayern Munich have appointed Vincent Kompany as their new head coach after agreeing a compensation package of about £10m with Burnley.\nKompany has signed a three-year contract with Bayern, who made a surprise move for him having failed to persuade Thomas Tuchel to remain at the end of the season. Xabi Alonso, their former coach Julian Nagelsmann, and Austria’s coach Ralf Rangnick had turned down the post.\n\n\n\n\nKompany has experience of the Bundesliga from his playing days at Hamburg and is fluent in German, although his appointment represents a bold move after Burnley’s relegation from the Premier League. Kompany enjoyed an outstanding first season at Turf Moor, winning the Championship with 101 points, but oversaw a poor Premier League campaign that brought only five wins.\n“It’s a great honour to be able to work for this club,” said Kompany. “FC Bayern is an institution in international football. As a coach, you have to stand for who you are as a person: I love having the ball, being creative and we also have to be aggressive on the pitch and courageous. I’m now looking forward to the most basic things: working with the players, building a team. When the foundation is in place, success will follow.”\n\n\n\n\nBayern’s sporting director, Christoph Freund, said: “Vincent Kompany is a type of coach who fits in very well with FC Bayern’s playing philosophy and identity: his teams want the ball, want to play dominant and high-intensity football. He is a young, very ambitious coach who brings a lot of international experience, has his finger on the pulse of the players and knows exactly what should happen on the pitch. He can and will give our team an enormous amount.”\nBurnley’s search for a replacement to lead them back into the Premier League is under way. In a statement confirming Kompany’s departure, the club said: “Whilst we were initially confident in retaining our manager, the changing dynamics of the situation made this impossible. We understand the allure and prestige of a club like Bayern Munich and respect Vincent’s ambition to explore new opportunities. We have started the search for a new manager and will make an announcement in due course.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like:\n\n\n\nWhy Bayern are after Kompany\n\n \n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
