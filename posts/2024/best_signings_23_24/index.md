# Best European Signings of the 2023-24 Season

With the campaign almost over, DATAIDEA picks out the best bits of business done by the continent's top clubs last summer...

One can never be quite sure how transfers will turn out. Even the most talented players can struggle at top clubs because of variables like personality clashes with the coach, fitness problems, language barriers, and cultural differences. However, some deals go better than anyone could have expected. This season, we've seen expensive signings handle the pressure of a big transfer fee, while other, previously unknown players have proven themselves bargain buys.

But, looking at all the deals done last summer, who's proven the best value for money? Below, DATAIDEA ranks the 10 best signings of the season:

**10. Granit Xhaka - Bayer Leverkusen (£21.4m)**
Granit Xhaka left Arsenal to join an even more exciting young team managed by a better coach. At 31, Xhaka is playing the best football of his career, providing experience, tenacity, and technique to Xabi Alonso's sensational Bayer Leverkusen side, who are now two games away from a treble after winning their first-ever Bundesliga.

**9. Riccardo Calafiori - Bologna (£3.4m)**
Riccardo Calafiori exemplifies the miraculous work done at Bologna by coach Thiago Motta and technical director Giovanni Sartori. The 21-year-old, bought from Basel for a pittance, played a pivotal role in Bologna's qualification for the Champions League for the first time ever, transforming from a left-back into one of the classiest central defenders in Serie A.

**8. Jude Bellingham - Real Madrid (£88m)**
Jude Bellingham's transfer from Borussia Dortmund to Real Madrid looked like a steal, and he's proven it. Bellingham has had one of the most impressive debut seasons from a Galactico, scoring 23 goals, including two stoppage-time Clasico winners. He could next week get his hands on the Champions League trophy.

**7. Marcus Thuram - Inter (free)**
Inter snapped up Marcus Thuram on a free transfer after his contract with Borussia Monchengladbach expired. With his pace, hold-up play, and selfless running, Thuram proved the ideal foil for Lautaro Martinez and contributed 15 goals himself. No wonder Inter fans have forgotten about Romelu Lukaku!

Viktor Gyokeres went from playing Championship football to being linked with Europe's biggest clubs after a stellar season with Sporting CP. The Swede has an outrageous record of 43 goals in all competitions, helping Sporting win the title and aim for a domestic double.
